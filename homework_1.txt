CST 2406 – Systems Design and Analysis – Homework 1


Git workflow scenarios – In each scenario assume the user name is squash_addict and the
repository name is called ramy_ashour_2406. Give the exact commands required in each scenario.


Scenario 1: no flashdrive, using a public computer. Assuming a github repository already exists,
explain the steps necessary to modify a file that already exists in the repository.
-Modify file
-git add file
-git commit -m "______"
-git push



Scenario 2: using a private computer. Assuming a github repository already exists but isn’t currently
on the laptop in question, explain the steps necessary to remove a file from the project.
-git rm
-git commit -m 
-git push


Scenario 3: copy of repository on flashdrive, using a public computer. Assuming you already have
a copy of your repository on a flashdrive, explain the steps necessary to add a new file to the project.
-Install client
-git clone url
-adding new file
-git add file 
-git commit -m
-git push


Scenario 4: two or more private computers, multiple participants. Assuming a github repository
exists on several private computers and is being modified by various participants over time, explain the
steps necessary for you to modify a file in the project. Assume that you’ve just been notified by one of
your team members that they’ve just updated the project.
-Add collaborator's username
