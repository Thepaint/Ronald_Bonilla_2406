28. Estimate the technical feasibility of the proposed system.
How fast can we get the system up and running.
A contracted hire based service where you 
make a tagged based case with a description and put in a certain
amount of people you want for the job as to which you may hire
 for yourselves.





29. Estimate the operational feasibility of the proposed system.
Can my company work the way it does? 
What if a contractor tried to hire more than 6 people for the job?
What to do when there's an invalid address
How do we get people to join our cause?
Will our brand of business do well?
Is there demand for this kind of work?




30. Estimate the economic feasibility of the proposed system.
How much money will the system make.
So we intend to have different workers who chances are
want to get more experience or do have it but want to
have a more independent approach to the job market.
It's contracted work so let's say 55% percent of case 
goes to the workers to get the ball rolling and there's hourly rates 
as to how long a job takes so let's say 8 hours at $12 which would bring
a worker to $96 plus the 55% commission rate would bring a worker to
$148.8 per case.  Workers getting hired cut a bit into profits since, they're
making money for us but however we want to discourage too many workers
working on one case.




31. Estimate the schedule feasibility of the proposed system.
How long will it take to develop?
Current estimates say about 4 weeks to get everything
done from designing to implementation.
Assuming everything goes right,we could finish ahead 
of time by a week if there's no delays, holidays, illness, or 
system failure. However if the absolute worst were to happen
all the time, the project could end up being delayed by several
weeks (1-2 weeks off schedule)




32. Do these feasibility estimates describe a system which corresponds to that described in the scope definition?
Personally, it may need a bit more refinement.
